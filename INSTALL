|       INSTALLATION        |
-----------------------------

In order to make installation easier, we have developed several binary 
installers for IPRStats.  By going to http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats and 
clicking on “Downloads”, you can find the list of the most current installers 
for your system.  We currently have Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu installers 
(tested on Vista, Snow Leopard, and Lucid Lynx respectively).

WINDOWS
-----------------------------

Before installing IPRStats, you must have several dependencies installed.  
Installation of these dependencies is very straightforward:
    + Python 2.6 available at http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.5/.
    + wxPython 2.8 runtime (unicode) available at
      http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

Once you have these two dependencies installed, you can download and install 
IPRStats.  Navigate to http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats and click the 
“Downloads” link.  Choose the IPRStats-0.4.win32 installer and run it.  This 
will install IPRStats and add a shortcut to your Windows start menu.

MAC OS X
-----------------------------

The Mac OS X application can be downloaded from 
http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats by clicking the “Downloads” link and 
downloading the Mac application.  IPRStats comes packaged in a .dmg disk 
image.  You must open the image and drag the application to your Applications 
folder (or anywhere on your computer) before double clicking it.

UBUNTU / DEBIAN
-----------------------------

A debian installer is provided at http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats in the 
download section.  Download the installer and double click it to open aptitude
which will download and install any missing dependencies you may have.  The 
installer will add a menu item under the Science section in Gnome.

OTHER
-----------------------------

It should be possible to run IPRStats on any *nix, Solaris, or BSD system on 
which you can install its dependencies.  These dependencies are:
    + Python 2.6
    + wxPython 2.8

You must also have an Internet connection if you wish to download charts.  
After the dependencies are installed, download the source code from 
http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats as either a zip or tarfile by clicking 
“Download Source.”  Extract the contents to a location on your computer and 
run “iprstats.py” inside the “iprstats” folder. 

OPTIONAL
-----------------------------

You can optionally install the following Python modules for additional chart 
types:
    + NumPy and Matplotlib available at
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/ and
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
      respectively.

USING MYSQL
-----------------------------

It is highly recommended that you use MySQL for large XML files. By default 
IPRStats uses SQLite as the database to store and query data extracted from a 
given InterProScan XML file.  IPRStats gives you MySQL connection options in 
its properties dialog, however, you must first install the Python module 
MySQLdb.

On Windows, you must compile MySQLdb from source, which requires several 
development libraries.  System engineer Yun Fu has written a very good article
on installing MySQLdb on Windows which can be found at
http://www.fuyun.org/2009/12/install-mysql-for-python-on-windows/

On Mac, you must also compile MySQLdb from source.  It may be necessary to 
install Xcode from your OSX installation disk to have Apple's gcc installed. 
Mangoorange has written very clear instructions for doing so at
http://www.mangoorange.com/2008/08/01/installing-python-mysqldb-122-on-mac-os-x/

Many Linux distributions have MySQLdb available through their package 
management systems.  Using aptitude, you can install it via the command prompt
by typing: sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb

Note that if you want to install a local MySQL database, you will need to 
install the MySQL server.  The MySQL Community server can be downloaded at 
http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.  IPRStats has been tested with version 
5.1 but should work with other versions.

|         QUICK RUN         |
-----------------------------

After you install, a quick test run:

1. Download l43967.xml from here:
   http://github.com/downloads/devrkel/IPRStats/L43967.xml
2. Run IPRStats
3. File -> Open
4. Choose L43967.xml
5. Wait. Loading can take up to 2 minutes
6. Once you see a table and pie chart, IPRStats is ready for you to browse the
   functional content of Mycoplasma genitalium's genome
