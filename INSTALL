General installation

   General installation is required for installing both the
   IPRStats server and standalone applications.  These instructions
   will guide you through setting up a MySQL database, extracting
   the source code, and configuring the application.

   1. Setting up the database
     
      If you do not have administrative access to a MySQL database,
      download and setup the MySQL Community Server from
      http://www.mysql.com/downloads/
      
      From the terminal, bring up the MySQL interactive prompt by
      typing "mysql -u<user> -p" where <user> is a user with
      database creation rights, and then that users' password.
      
      At the mysql prompt, type "create database <database_name>"
      where <database_name> is the name of the database that
      will contain the IPRStats data.
      
   2. Getting the source code
      
      Now get a copy of the project's source code from
      http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats.  This can be accomplished
      in two ways:
      
      a. Git
         
         You download an install the latest version of Git from
         http://git-scm.com/download
         
         From the terminal, navigate to the directory you where
         you want to install IPRStats.
         
         Download a copy of the source code and change into the
         source folder by typing:
         
           git clone git://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats.git
           cd IPRStats/src/
         
      b. ZIP or TAR
         
         From http://github.com/devrkel/IPRStats click on the button
         labeled "Download Source".
          
         Save the chosen file and extract it to the directory you
         want to install IPRStats.
          
         Navigate to the extracted directory and open the "src"
         folder.
          
   3. Configuring IPRStats
      
      In the "src" folder, open the configuration file "iprstats.cfg"
      in a text editor.
      
      In the "[local db]" section, edit the host, user, passwd, and db
      settings to allow IPRStats write access to the MySQL database
      specified by "db".
      
      Optional: If you have a local mirror of the GO terms database,
      you can modify those options here and set "go_lookup" to "true".
      If not using a local mirror, setting "go_lookup" to "true" may
      result in a significant slow down.
      
      Save "ipsstats.cfg".
       
Running as a standalone application

   Assuming you correctly set-up the MySQL database and configured
   IPRStats accordingly, the IPRStats standalone should work correctly.

   1. From a terminal, navigate to "IPRStats/src/" and type
      "python standalone.py". A dialog box should open up.
   
   2. From File select Open... and choose the InterProStats output file
      you wish to open.

   3. Depending on the size of the file, you may have to wait several
      minutes before you can view the IPRStats generated information.
